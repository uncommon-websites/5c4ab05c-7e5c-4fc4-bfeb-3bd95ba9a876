      When you add a new location to newRota, we'll automatically apply your scheduling preferences and shift templates. Staff can be assigned to multiple locations, and the AI will optimize their schedules across all venues.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to manage staff who work at multiple locations, enable cross-location scheduling. This ensures fair distribution of shifts and prevents double-booking across your entire business.

      <h3 class="text-gray-900 font-bold text-lg mb-2">Custom shift templates for each location</h3>
      <p>
        Create unique shift patterns for each venue based on their specific needs. Your downtown gym might need more trainers during lunch, while your suburban location peaks in the evening. newRota remembers these patterns and applies them automatically.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Templates can be shared across locations or customized individually. This gives you flexibility while maintaining consistency across your business.
